# Djs+

Based on the popular [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/), Djs+ is a superior discord API library that can do everything discord.js can do but more! Hell, it's so intuitive that you don't even need to read any docs (or even mighty YouTube tutorials) to know how to use it!

# Djs+ V.S. discord.js

Area | discord.js | Djs+
---- | ------ | ------
Reliability | Crashes often, code does not work most of the time. The support channels just insult your intelligence when you ask for help. | Code will always work (very well might I add) and do exactly what you want it to do and almost never crashes. It uses the hosting hardware's spare and otherwise unused processing power on it's built-in AI that scans for memory leaks and parts of your code to change the its behaviour to prevent crashes (I swear it's not just a cryptominer). It only changes in memory, so your original beautiful code (made even more beautiful by Djs+'s syntax) will remain untouched.
Security | Bots are easily broken by hackers and token is easily stolen. Again, d.js support will just blame you for leaking it. | Not a single Djs+ bot has ever been broken or token-grabbed. You could literally share your token and your bot won't nuke your servers. In addition to that, Djs+'s source code is kept a secret so that hackers can't find ways to hack your bot through a library exploit!
Scalability | Does not automatically shard when necessary and isn't webscale by default. | Spawns new shards when necessary (not that Djs+ is slow enough to ever have to do that anyway) and is webscale from the moment you connect to the gateway. Perfect for your Five Nights at Freddy's hentai bot!
Diversity | Doesn't support real, authentic user accounts, restricting what your bot can do. | Seamlessly supports the mighty user account! When you make a userbot, Djs+ will use it's AI to automatically join server's it is needed in thanks to the superior user accounts ability to automagically join servers with regular invites.
Freedom | Enforces Discord's stupid concept that is rate-limiting, meaning your bot can't do things as quickly, which is very impractical in our fast modern lifestyles. | Doesn't suck the dicksword and uses l33t h4xx to bypass rate-limiting! You will only be limited by your connection, which may never happen due to Djs+'s networking efficiency! It also has built-in support for rainbow roles. Suck it Citron!
